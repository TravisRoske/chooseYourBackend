//Entire process
Nodejs server serves, Choose your language
TypeScript
Assigns you an id
Choose your database
MySQL

Then, the server  sends the new index.html, and routes you to it

database console:
-get all users
-sends get to /db or something, with data object(info the user entered)
-this sends a request to the db server 
-server queries the db
-returns to main servers
-returns to user
-(also updates the users and the databases expiration to after another hour.)

-then the front end displays the data



ToDo:
-Database deleting and userid timestamp validation systems, and userid string validation
    -backend checks the timer, deletes it if timed out, and assigns new one
-Build the dababase timeout and deletion system
    -all usernames and timestamps saved in a small database(with the name of the server they are on)
    -check them every minute or so, find all expired ones
    -send each of these to a delete function on their respective servers
    -db servers delete the db

-Build a shitty basic front end
-Get this all going on a single ec2 instance for now.(with containers on it or ecs or lambda)
    -make an ec2 instance
    -pull mainserver, db server, and frontend builds
-Set up nginx, and other stuff like logging, server process and restart(main and dbserver), static ec2 ip address, etc
-Go live
