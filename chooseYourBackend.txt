ToDo:

	-Change that.....Maybe it could build automatically to public or to mainserver
-Change github structure, one for each partition
-Set up ci/cd for repos
    
-Set up nginx, and other stuff like logging, server process and restart(main and dbserver), static ec2 ip address, etc
-get domain name

-build tests for the backend
    -test each main function
    -end to end tests
